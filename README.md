# auto-maze

Create a random maze. Use an algorithm powered by a random* number generator to fill in a grid of squares, then fabricate Javascript code that will let a person view and 'walk through' the maze in a browser window.

Installation:
(1) Download auto-maze/grid into a new directory on your computer

Usage:
(1) In your web browser, open the file .../grid/index.html;
(2) Optionally select a Width, then click 'Make a Green Maze';
(3) A new window will open with the randomly generated maze. Move your mouse (no need to click) to try to travel from the entrance at the bottom to the central square;
(4) If you move your mouse out of the window, the path will slowly erase itself.

*__random__: (of a number generator) predictable; (of a data-access method) unpredictable.
