# auto-maze

Create a random maze. Use an algorithm powered by a random* number generator to fill in a grid of squares, then fabricate Javascript code that will let a person view and 'walk through' the maze in a browser window.

*__random__: (of a number generator) predictable; (of a data-access method) unpredictable.
